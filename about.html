				<div><h2>A Bit More About Me</h2></div>
					<p>As you know, I'm Ana, but my full name is Anastasia Meleshko.</p>
					<p>I was named after the last Grand Duchess of Russia 
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Duchess_Anastasia_Nikolaevna_of_Russia"
					target="_blank">
					Anastasia Nikolaevna Romanova
					</a>. </p>
					<p>My parents immigrated from Belarus to the states in 1999 
					because my dad was offered a job at Microsoft as a software engineer.
					And yet, I have spent a lot of my energy doing everything in my power to avoid also going into the computer science field.</p>
					<p> ...well, except for taking this class...</p>
					<p>Instead I enjoy doing other creative things in life, like 
					<a href="https://strawpix.github.io/PROG109/art.html">
					art
					</a>
					.
					<p> I have a rescue cat named Oscar and a Boder Collie named Ray.</p>
					<p> I decidedly like Oscar more, but he hates me. 
					The heart wants what the heart can't have, I guess. </p>
					<br>
					<p> By the end of Spring 2019, I hope to get my Transfer Aossiates Degree in Arts and Science, 
					as well as to graduate from high school. </p>
					<p>My goal is to have a career in scientific illustration, 
					or some other combination of biology and studio art.</p>
					<p> So that's a bit about me! If you have any questions, comments, concerns, feel free to
